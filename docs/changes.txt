Build 0.0.1 26-08-1999 First approach
                       Known bugs: Generated REXX code might include lines
                                   that exceed maximal length (fixed in 0.06).
                                   ASCII entryfield shows entry only up to
                                   first byte with zero value (still there).
Build 0.0.2 02-09-1999 Changed language from german to english.
Build 0.0.3 12-01-2000 Menu to choose INI files
Build 0.0.4 15-01-2000 Added NSCP.INI and DOIP.INI
Build 0.0.5 16-01-2000 Added LSUSE.INI, LSSHARE.INI, NETGUI.INI
Build 0.0.6 20-01-2000 Fixed the long line issue, hex mode should be
                       bullet prove now, ASCII mode still only works
                       up to first byte with zero value 
Build 0.0.7 10-03-2001 Added REXX concatenation operator (||) to
                       produce really proper REXX code. Added
                       general help menu. Strip blanks from filename
                       of REXX script.
